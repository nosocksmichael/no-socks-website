                  <p className="text-gray-700">Start gradually! Begin by going sockless at home for a few hours, then work up to wearing sockless-friendly shoes for short trips. Choose breathable, well-fitting shoes designed for barefoot wear. Most people transition fully within 1-2 weeks.</p>

                  <p className="text-gray-700">Initially, yes, but your circulation actually improves over time! Many people report warmer feet after 2-3 weeks as blood flow increases. For cold weather, choose insulated, sockless-friendly shoes.</p>

                  <p className="text-gray-700">When done properly, yes! Your feet actually stay cleaner and healthier. Without socks trapping moisture and bacteria, your feet breathe better and develop stronger natural defenses.</p>

                  <p className="text-gray-700">Surprisingly, no! Socks often trap moisture and bacteria that cause odor. Barefoot feet in breathable shoes actually smell less over time. The key is letting your feet breathe.</p>

                  <p className="text-gray-700">Look for shoes made from breathable materials (leather, canvas, mesh), with good ventilation, and designed for barefoot wear. Many brands now make 'sockless-friendly' options. Avoid synthetic materials that don't breathe.</p>
