# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Title
Next-Gen Note-Taking Module

## Document Control
| Version | Date | Author | Change Description |
|---------|------|--------|--------------------|
| 1.0 | {{DATE}} | AI Assistant | Initial draft |

## 1. Purpose
Provide users with a robust, intuitive, and secure environment to create, organize, and retrieve personal or collaborative notes across devices.

## 2. Background & Motivation
Current platform lacks native note-taking. Users rely on external tools, causing fragmented workflows and data silos. Introducing an integrated module improves retention, streamlines knowledge management, and creates upsell opportunities (e.g., premium storage, AI summarization).

## 3. Objectives & Goals
1. Allow users to create, edit, organize, and search notes in < 3 clicks.
2. Sync notes across web and mobile with < 5 s latency.
3. Achieve 95%+ task success rate in usability tests.
4. Reach 30% adoption among active users within 6 months of launch.

## 4. Success Metrics (KPIs)
• Daily Active Note Users (DANU)
• Avg. Notes Created per User per Week
• Note Retrieval Success Rate
• Sync Error Rate (< 0.1%)
• Avg. Load Time for Notes (< 400 ms P95)

## 5. Scope
### In-Scope
- CRUD operations for text-based notes (Markdown & Rich Text)
- Folder/Tag-based organization
- Full-text search with filters (date, tag, content)
- Real-time sync & offline caching (PWA)
- Version history (up to 30 days)
- Import from .txt/.md and export to .md/.pdf
- Sharing via view/edit links (permission control)

### Out-of-Scope (Phase 1)
- Handwriting recognition
- Audio & video notes
- End-to-end encryption (planned Phase 2)
- AI summarization & sentiment analysis

## 6. User Personas & Stories
### Persona A – "Busy Professional"
Wants quick searchable meeting notes.
* Story:* "As a busy professional, I want to open a new note with a shortcut so I can capture thoughts without losing focus."

### Persona B – "Student Organizer"
Needs topic-based categorization and revision history.

### Persona C – "Collaborator"
Requires real-time co-editing and commenting.

## 7. Functional Requirements (FR)
| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| FR-01 | User can create a new note via 'New Note' button or keyboard shortcut | High |
| FR-02 | Notes support Markdown syntax & WYSIWYG toggle | High |
| FR-03 | Auto-save every 2 seconds or on blur | High |
| FR-04 | User can organize notes via drag-and-drop into folders | Medium |
| FR-05 | Tag notes and bulk edit tags | Medium |
| FR-06 | Full-text search across title & body with highlight | High |
| FR-07 | View version history and restore | Medium |
| FR-08 | Share note with permission levels: view, comment, edit | High |
| FR-09 | Conflict resolution on concurrent edits (last-writer-wins with diff UI) | High |
| FR-10 | Offline editing with background sync when online | High |

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)
| Category | NFR |
|----------|-----|
| Performance | 95th percentile response < 400 ms |
| Availability | 99.9% uptime SLA |
| Scalability | Support 1 M concurrent users |
| Security | OWASP Top 10 compliance, data encrypted at rest/in transit |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.1 AA |
| Localization | Support i18n (UTF-8, RTL languages) |

## 9. UX/UI Guidelines
- Minimalist editor with distraction-free mode
- Color-coded tags, drag-and-drop folder tree
- Command-palette (⌘/Ctrl + K) for quick actions
- Toast notifications for saves/errors
- Responsive design for ≤ 320 px wide screens
- Dark & light themes auto-detected

## 10. Data Model (Simplified)
```
User
  └─> Note(id, user_id, title, content_md, created_at, updated_at)
          └─> NoteVersion(id, note_id, content_md, saved_at)
  └─> Tag(id, user_id, name)
  └─> NoteTag(note_id, tag_id)
  └─> Share(id, note_id, shared_with_user_id, permission, expires_at)
```

## 11. API Endpoints (REST exemplar)
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | /api/notes | Create note |
| GET | /api/notes/:id | Retrieve note |
| PUT | /api/notes/:id | Update note |
| DELETE | /api/notes/:id | Delete note |
| GET | /api/notes | List & search |
| POST | /api/notes/:id/share | Share note |

## 12. Security & Privacy
- JWT auth with refresh tokens
- Row-level access control per note
- Audit logs for share actions
- GDPR & CCPA compliant data handling

## 13. Performance & Scalability
- Use indexed full-text search (e.g. PostgreSQL `tsvector`)
- WebSocket channel for real-time updates
- CDN cache for read-only shared notes

## 14. Dependencies
- Database: PostgreSQL 14+
- Backend: Node.js 20 + Express / Next.js API routes
- Frontend: Next.js 14 + React 18
- State Mgmt: Zustand / React Query
- Sync: WebSocket (Socket.IO) & Service Worker

## 15. Timeline & Milestones
| Milestone | Target Date | Owner |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Requirement Freeze | T+0 wk | PM |
| Design & POC | T+2 wk | UX / ENG |
| MVP Dev Complete | T+6 wk | ENG |
| Beta Launch | T+8 wk | QA / Beta Users |
| GA Release | T+10 wk | PM |

## 16. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Scope creep | High | Strict phase gate, PM sign-off |
| Data loss on sync conflicts | Medium | Implement robust conflict detection & backups |
| Performance degradation at scale | Medium | Load tests + auto-scaling |
| Security breaches | High | Regular pentest, automate scans |

## 17. Assumptions
- Users already authenticated via platform SSO
- Server supports WebSocket connections
- Mobile app will reuse same API

## 18. Open Questions
1. Will we support rich media embeds (images, code snippets) in Phase 1?
2. How many previous versions should be retained beyond 30 days?
3. Monetization strategy for premium features?

## 19. Glossary
- **CRUD**: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- **PWA**: Progressive Web App
- **DANU**: Daily Active Note Users
- **ETV**: Estimated Traffic Volume
